# SAFe Tooling — Project Context

@CLAUDE_SECURITY.md

## Purpose

This project builds tooling to support planning, tracking, and execution activities within the **Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)**. The primary focus is on Program Increment (PI) Planning and related ceremonies/artifacts.

## SAFe Domain Vocabulary

Understand these terms precisely before implementing any feature:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **PI** | Program Increment — a fixed timebox (typically 8–12 weeks) containing 4–5 Iterations plus an Innovation & Planning (IP) iteration |
| **ART** | Agile Release Train — the long-lived team-of-teams that delivers value; typically 50–125 people |
| **Team** | An Agile team on the ART; 5–11 people including a Scrum Master and Product Owner |
| **Iteration** | A 2-week sprint within a PI |
| **Feature** | A service or function that fulfills a stakeholder need; sized to fit in a PI |
| **Story** | A small unit of work that fits within one Iteration, belonging to a Feature |
| **Epic** | A large initiative spanning multiple PIs; may have a Lean Business Case |
| **PI Objectives** | Business outcomes a team or ART commits to for a PI; rated by Business Value (1–10) |
| **WSJF** | Weighted Shortest Job First — prioritization formula: (CoD + ToD + RR/OE) / Job Size |
| **CoD** | Cost of Delay — value lost by not delivering; sum of User/Business Value, Time Criticality, Risk Reduction / Opportunity Enablement |
| **ROAM** | Risk disposition: Resolved, Owned, Accepted, Mitigated |
| **RTE** | Release Train Engineer — servant leader and coach for the ART |
| **Program Board** | Visual artifact mapping Features to Iterations, showing team dependencies |
| **Dependency** | A cross-team or cross-ART reliance that must be coordinated |
| **Capacity** | Available person-days per team per Iteration, accounting for PTO and overhead |
| **Load** | Estimated Story Points or hours committed by a team in an Iteration |
| **IP Iteration** | Innovation & Planning iteration at the end of a PI; not used for regular feature delivery |
| **ART Sync** | Short, regular cross-team coordination meeting during the PI |
| **Inspect & Adapt (I&A)** | End-of-PI ceremony: PI System Demo + quantitative measurement + problem-solving workshop |

## Key Formulas

```
WSJF = Cost of Delay / Job Duration (relative sizing, 1–13 scale)
Cost of Delay = User/Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction/Opportunity Enablement

Predictability = (Actual Business Value / Planned Business Value) * 100
Target: 80–100%

Team Load % = (Committed Story Points / Available Capacity) * 100
Target: ≤ 100%, warn at > 90%

Available Capacity = (Team Size × Iteration Days − PTO Days) × (1 − Overhead %)
Default overhead: 20%
```

## Entity Relationships

```
ART  1──* Team
ART  1──* PI
PI   1──* Iteration
PI   1──* Feature
PI   1──* Risk
PI   1──* PIObjective  (via Team)
PI   1──* Dependency
Team 1──* PIObjective
Team 1──* CapacityPlan  (one per Iteration)
Feature *──1 Team  (assigned team)
Feature 1──* Story
Feature 1──* Dependency  (feature_id FK)
Story  belongs to Team and Iteration
```

All relationships use ID references (never embedded objects). `PI.iteration_ids`, `Feature.story_ids`, etc. store lists of IDs; the repository layer loads related entities separately. This avoids dual-write bugs in TinyDB.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Library | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Language | Python 3.14 | |
| CLI | Typer (`typer[all]`) | Subcommand structure, `--help` generation |
| HTTP API | FastAPI + uvicorn | REST API matching `docs/openapi.yaml` |
| Data models | Pydantic v2 | Validated models with `computed_field` for derived values |
| Persistence | TinyDB | JSON-backed local store at `~/.safe_tooling/db.json` |
| Terminal output | Rich (bundled with Typer) | Colored tables, status indicators |
| Spreadsheet I/O | openpyxl | Import/export for PI Planning Excel artifacts |
| Testing | pytest + pytest-cov + httpx | |
| Mutation testing | mutmut `>=2,<3` | Nightly CI job scoped to `safe/logic/`; pinned to v2 because v3 removed the `html` subcommand used in the report step |

Install: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
Run CLI: `safe --help`
Run API: `safe-api` (or `podman compose up -d --build`)

> **Always run the full CI check suite locally before pushing.** The CI pipeline runs three steps in order — all must pass:
> ```bash
> python -m ruff check .        # lint
> python -m ruff format --check .  # formatting (separate from lint — easy to miss!)
> python -m pytest tests/       # tests
> ```
> `ruff check` and `ruff format` are **independent** — passing one does not imply passing the other. Always run both. To auto-fix, run `ruff check . --fix && ruff format .` before committing.

> **Package discovery:** `pyproject.toml` pins setuptools to `include = ["safe*"]` via `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]`. If you add a new top-level directory (e.g. a second language runtime, a docs generator, a scripts folder), setuptools flat-layout auto-discovery will break the build with "Multiple top-level packages discovered". Either keep non-Python directories out of the project root, or update the `include` list explicitly.

## Technical Conventions

**Models**
- All models live in `safe/models/`; import via `safe.models` (the `__init__.py`), not individual files.
- Every entity inherits `SAFeBaseModel` (`safe/models/base.py`), which provides the `id: str` field with a `uuid4` default.
- Computed fields (`wsjf_score`, `cost_of_delay`, `available_capacity`, `is_committed`) use Pydantic `@computed_field`. They are **never stored** — `Repository.save()` derives exclusions at runtime via `model_computed_fields.keys()` and they are recomputed on `model_validate()`.
- `date` fields serialise to ISO strings via `model_dump(mode="json")` and round-trip correctly through `model_validate`.

**Persistence**
- All storage goes through `Repository[T]` in `safe/store/repository.py`. No code should call `TinyDB` directly outside `store/`.
- Use `get_repos()` to obtain all repositories. Pass a `TinyDB` instance (from `get_db(path)`) in tests to avoid touching the real database. **Important:** use `db if db is not None else get_db()` — not `db or get_db()` — because TinyDB defines `__len__` and an empty database is falsy.
- `save()` is an upsert keyed on `id`. Deletion of entities referenced by others should check for downstream references first.
- When creating relationships (e.g. adding a team to an ART), perform the dual-write explicitly: save the child entity first, then update and save the parent's ID list.

**Logic**
- Business logic lives in pure functions in `safe/logic/`. No I/O, no TinyDB, no Rich imports.
- CLI modules (`safe/cli/`) are the only place Rich rendering happens.
- CLI commands call logic functions; logic functions accept model objects or plain scalars.

**CLI structure**
- Each CLI module (`art.py`, `team.py`, `pi.py`) owns its own `console = Console()` and a `_repos()` helper that reads `state.db_path`.
- The root callback in `main.py` sets `state.db_path` when `--db-path` is passed; all sub-apps pick it up via `safe.cli.state`.
- Tests that patch Rich output must monkeypatch the specific module's `console`, not just `main.console`.

**API structure**
- All API route prefixes use **singular resource names**: `/art`, `/team`, `/pi`, `/iterations`, `/features`, `/stories`, `/objectives`, `/risks`, `/dependencies`, `/capacity-plans`. Never use plurals like `/arts` or `/teams`.
- Domain models are used directly as `response_model`. Request bodies always use separate `*Create` / `*Update` schemas from `schemas.py` — never expose `id`, computed fields, or relationship ID lists (`team_ids`, `story_ids`, etc.) in request bodies.
- PATCH handlers use `model_copy(update=body.model_dump(exclude_unset=True))` — `exclude_unset=True` is required so omitted fields are not overwritten with `None`.
- 404 → `HTTPException(404)`, state machine violations → `HTTPException(409)`, validation → FastAPI raises 422 automatically.
- API tests use the `client` fixture from `tests/conftest.py` which injects a fresh `tmp_path` TinyDB via `app.dependency_overrides[get_repos_dep]`.
- The API DB lifecycle is independent of the CLI's `state.db_path` singleton — configured via `SAFE_DB_PATH` env var.

**Testing**
- Repository tests use `tmp_path` fixture to get a fresh TinyDB per test.
- Logic tests are pure unit tests with no I/O.
- CLI tests use `typer.testing.CliRunner` with `--db-path` pointing to a tmp file. Each test module includes an `autouse` `reset_state` fixture that sets `state.db_path = None` before and after each test to prevent state leaking between invocations.
- API tests use `fastapi.testclient.TestClient` with `app.dependency_overrides` to inject a `tmp_path` TinyDB — see `tests/conftest.py`.

## Git Workflow

- Each new feature or phase must be developed on its own branch, branched from `main`.
- Branch naming: `feat/<short-description>` (e.g. `feat/phase-3-backlog-manager`).
- Every feature branch must have its own PR targeting `main` before being merged.
- Never commit feature work directly to `main`.

## Documentation

- **Always update `README.md` when completing a phase or adding new commands.** This means:
  - Marking the feature as "Working" (not "Planned") in the What's implemented table.
  - Adding usage examples for every new command group.
  - Updating the Project Layout section if new files were added.
- **Always update `CLAUDE.md` build phase status** to **Done** when a phase is complete.
- Documentation updates must be committed on the same branch as the feature work, before the PR is created.

## Out of Scope

- Full ALM/project management system replacement (not Jira/Rally)
- Portfolio-level SAFe artifacts (Value Streams, Strategic Themes) unless explicitly added later
- Multi-ART coordination (single ART focus for now)
- Multi-user or shared access (local single-user tool only)
